A Streamlit application that simulates a witty debate between OpenAI and DeepSeek, styled as a culinary battle between a luxury chef and a street food vendor. Watch as they argue about AI development through creative cooking metaphors!

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv $HOME\.venv
$HOME\.venv\Scripts\Activate  # On Windows
source .venv/bin/activate     # On Unix/MacOS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Running the Project

### Part 1: Debate Simulator
```bash
# Start the Streamlit debate app
streamlit run debate_app.py
```

The debate interface will:
- Show a debate between OpenAI and DeepSeek
- Allow progression with "Next Turn" button
- Display color-coded messages with avatars
- Enable debate reset

### Part 2: Thinking Models Testing

1. Test API Connection:
```bash
python test_api.py
```

2. Test DeepSeek Thinking:
```bash
python test_deepseek_thinking.py
```

3. Test DeepSeek Reasoning:
```bash
python deepseektesting.py
```

Each test will show:
- Blue text: Reasoning process
- Green text: Final content
- Detailed thought process

### Example Test Outputs

**DeepSeek Thinking Test:**
```
=== Testing prompt: What is deixis? ===
[Blue] Reasoning through linguistic concepts...
[Green] Deixis refers to words that...
```

**API Connection Test:**
```
Environment Debug:
API Key format: sk-or-v1-...
Success! Response: Hello, testing the connection!
```

## Overview

This project creates an engaging debate simulation where:
- OpenAI plays a luxury chef, emphasizing premium ingredients and extensive resources
- DeepSeek acts as a street food vendor, focusing on efficiency and minimal resources
- Both debate AI model training through culinary metaphors

## Dependencies

The project requires the following main dependencies:

- **Core**
  - streamlit: Web application framework
  - asyncio: Asynchronous I/O support
  - python-dotenv: Environment variable management

- **HTTP & API**
  - httpx: Modern HTTP client for Python
    - Supports both sync and async requests
    - Provides streaming capabilities
    - Compatible with Python's async/await syntax
    - Similar API to the requests library but with async support
    - Used for direct OpenRouter API communication
    - Seamless integration with Streamlit:
      ```python
      # Example in debate_app.py
      async def get_next_response(self):
          async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
              response = await client.post(
                  "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
                  headers=headers,
                  json=data
              )
              # Streamlit updates in real-time
              st.write(response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
      ```
    - Handles streaming responses in Streamlit UI
    - Maintains async compatibility with Streamlit's event loop
  - aiohttp: Async HTTP client

- **Data Handling**
  - pyyaml: YAML file processing

- **Testing**
  - pytest: Testing framework
  - pytest-asyncio: Async testing support

Install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

## Recent Updates

## AI Thinking Models Testing

This sub-project contains utilities for testing various AI models' thinking and reasoning capabilities.

### Test Files

#### 0. API Connection Test (`test_api.py`)
```python
# API connection testing and configuration validation
# Features:
- Validates OpenRouter API key format and presence
- Tests basic API connectivity
- Loads and validates configuration from config.yaml
- Provides detailed debugging information
```

Example usage:
```bash
python test_api.py
```

Example output:
```
Environment Debug:
Working directory: C:/dev/debate3
.env file location: C:/dev/debate3/.env
API Key format: sk-or-v1-...abcd
API Key length: 64
Starts with 'sk-or-v1-': True

Success! Response: Hello, testing the connection!
```

Required files:
- `.env`: Contains API credentials
- `config.yaml`: Contains agent configurations

#### 1. Test Thinking Models (`testthinkingmodels.py`)
```python
# Basic testing of AI reasoning using OpenRouter API
# Features:
- Tests Aion-1.0 model
- Streams responses with reasoning
- Includes system context for consistent responses
```

#### 2. DeepSeek Thinking Test (`test_deepseek_thinking.py`)
```python
# Tests O1's thinking responses through OpenRouter
# Features:
- Colored output (blue for reasoning, green for content)
- Step-by-step reasoning display
- Structured XML-style thinking tags
```

#### 3. DeepSeek Testing (`deepseektesting.py`)
```python
# Tests DeepSeek-R1 model's reasoning capabilities
# Features:
- Complete reasoning process display
- Streaming response handling
- Separate tracking of content and reasoning
```

### Setup for Testing

1. Set up environment variables:
```bash
OPENROUTER_API_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Install additional dependencies:
```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv
```

### Running Tests

Test individual models:
```bash
# Test Aion model
python testthinkingmodels.py

# Test O1 thinking
python test_deepseek_thinking.py

# Test DeepSeek reasoning
python deepseektesting.py
```

### Example Output

```
=== Testing prompt: What is deixis? ===

<think>Let me break this down step by step:
1. First, let's understand the etymology...
2. Now, let's consider the concept...</think>

Deixis refers to words and phrases that...
```

### Models Tested

- **Aion-1.0**: General reasoning capabilities
- **O1-Preview**: Structured thinking with color coding
- **DeepSeek-R1**: Detailed reasoning process

### Notes

- Each test file can be run independently
- Responses are streamed in real-time
- Reasoning is displayed distinctly from content
- All tests use the OpenRouter API for model access
