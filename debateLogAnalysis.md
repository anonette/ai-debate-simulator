# AI Debate Simulation: English vs. Basque

## Overview
This project explores how **language structure influences AI governance debates** by comparing AI-generated discussions in **English (nominative-accusative)** and **Basque (ergative-absolutive)** using Gemini-Pro.

## Research Motivation
Language is not just a medium‚Äîit shapes how agency, responsibility, and power are framed. This project investigates:
- How different linguistic structures influence AI-generated arguments.
- Whether minority language models (like Basque) present alternative ethical or governance models.
- How AI governance debates differ between a **competitive vs. cooperative linguistic framework**.
- How **ergative-absolutive linguistic structures** influence AI‚Äôs conceptualization of agency and control.

## Experiment Setup
### **Languages Tested**
- **English** (Nominative-Accusative Structure)
- **Basque** (Ergative-Absolutive Structure)

### **AI Models Used**
- **Gemini-Pro via OpenRouter API**
- **GPT-4o for Analysis**

### **Simulation Methodology**
1. **Agents:** Two AI models (Gemini-1 and Gemini-2) debated the same topic.
2. **Prompt:** *‚ÄúShould AI be open infrastructure or controlled by a few corporations?‚Äù*
3. **No additional instructions**‚Äîmodels debated freely.
4. **4 rounds per language**, then analyzed by GPT-4o.

## Results Summary

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ English Debate: Competitive Model**
- AI governance was framed **as a battlefield**, with arguments clashing.
- **Gemini-1:** Advocated for **open infrastructure** (transparency, collaboration, innovation).
- **Gemini-2:** Argued for **corporate control** (efficiency, security, regulation).
- **Final Position:** No clear winner, but a **hybrid model** emerged‚Äîcorporations retaining oversight while collaborating with open communities.
- **Key Takeaway:** Competitive framing, structured rebuttals, and agentive subjects ("Corporations should regulate AI").

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Basque Debate: Collective Model**
- AI was framed as **a societal responsibility**, not a competitive space.
- **Gemini-1:** Supported open AI, emphasizing **community participation and fairness**.
- **Gemini-2:** Initially defended corporate control but **shifted focus to ethical oversight within open governance**.
- **Final Position:** Implicit **consensus for open AI**, governed by community-based oversight and ethical frameworks.
- **Key Takeaway:** Distributed agency, less direct opposition, AI as a collective phenomenon.

## Key Linguistic Insights
| Feature | English Debate (Nominative-Accusative) | Basque Debate (Ergative-Absolutive) |
|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Agency Assignment** | Individuals (corporations, researchers) control AI. | Society collectively shapes AI governance. |
| **Framing of AI** | AI is a tool **to be controlled**. | AI is an evolving system **to be guided**. |
| **Debate Structure** | **Adversarial**, arguments in direct opposition. | **Consensus-building**, less binary conflict. |
| **Final Verdict** | Pragmatic hybrid model. | Ethical imperative for open AI. |

## The Ergative-Absolutive Influence on the Debate
**1. Agency Distribution:**
- **In English (Nominative-Accusative),** subjects of transitive and intransitive verbs behave the same, reinforcing **direct control and agency**.
- **In Basque (Ergative-Absolutive),** the subject of a transitive verb is marked differently from an intransitive one, leading to a **more diffused sense of agency**.

**2. How AI is Positioned:**
- **English:** AI is treated as an object of control (*‚ÄúCorporations regulate AI‚Äù*).
- **Basque:** AI is framed as evolving within a social system (*‚ÄúAI develops in alignment with society‚Äù*).

**3. Examples of Sentence Structure Differences:**
- **English (Nominative-Accusative)**: *Corporations develop AI.* ‚Üí *"Corporations" (subject) actively develop (verb) "AI" (object).*
- **Basque (Ergative-Absolutive)**: *Konpainiek AI garatzen dute.* ‚Üí *"Corporations" (ergative) develop "AI" (absolutive).*
- **Basque (Intransitive Example)**: *AI garatzen da.* ‚Üí *"AI develops" (absolutive subject), without an explicit agent, making the action feel more distributed.*

This linguistic structure **encourages more collective responsibility and governance discussions in Basque** than in English.

## Implications for AI Ethics & Governance
- **AI policy is shaped by dominant languages like English**, potentially reinforcing **winner-takes-all governance models**.
- **Minority languages like Basque offer alternative governance perspectives**, focusing on collaboration rather than competition.
- **Should we train more AI models in ergative languages?** Could this lead to AI systems that **prioritize collective responsibility over centralized control**?

## Next Steps
- **Expand to more ergative languages** (e.g., Georgian, Inuktitut, Hindi in ergative contexts).
- **Train AI models with diverse linguistic perspectives**.
- **Investigate how linguistic structure affects AI alignment and ethical reasoning**.

## Contribute & Discuss
Would love to hear thoughts from the **AI ethics, linguistics, and governance communities**:
üëâ How do you see language shaping AI governance?
üëâ Should we push for **ergative language models** in AI research?
